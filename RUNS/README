run directory with link to ../BIN/pert

run program pert after compiling in BIN

output files, given 3-state calculation:

onevec.dat

  first-order perturbation theory result.
  eight columns: time, E(t), then 3 complex amplitudes, first order result

onevec_abs.dat

  first-order perturbation theory result.
  five columns: time, E(t), then 3 populations (abs-value-squared of onevec.dat)

twovec.dat, twovec_abs.dat, threevec.dat, threevec_abs.dat etc.

  like onevec.dat and onevec_abs.dat, second and third order results

sumvec.dat

  sum of zeroth+first+second+third order result

sumvec_abs.dat

  sum of zeroth+first+second+third order result
  six columns, t=time, E(t), 3 populations, sum of the 3 populations
