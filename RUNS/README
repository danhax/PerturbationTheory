run directory with link to ../BIN/pert

Scripts run.impulse and run.regular do calculations for two different pulses with 3 states lambda model.

The scripts run the programs pert and exact.

Gnuplot scripts gnu.complex and gnu.abs plot the real and imaginary part of the amplitudes for states 2 and 3
in the interaction picture (regardless of which script you run).

-----

program exact:

outputs propvec.dat and propvec_abs.dat like the files below


program pert:

output files, given 3-state calculation:

onevec.dat

  first-order perturbation theory result.
  eight columns: time, E(t), then 3 complex amplitudes, first order result

onevec_abs.dat

  first-order perturbation theory result.
  five columns: time, E(t), then 3 populations (abs-value-squared of onevec.dat)

twovec.dat, twovec_abs.dat, threevec.dat, threevec_abs.dat etc.

  like onevec.dat and onevec_abs.dat, second and third order results

sumvec.dat

  sum of zeroth+first+second+third order result

sumvec_abs.dat

  sum of zeroth+first+second+third order result
  six columns, t=time, E(t), 3 populations, sum of the 3 populations
