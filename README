perturbation theory program.

Source in SRC/
Compliation directory BIN/
Run directory RUNS/

Input file RUNS/Input.Inp

  3 states, energies 0.95, 1.05, 10, pulse energy 9

Output files e.g. RUNS/twovec.dat

  contain populations as a function of time form perturbation theory

  first column t=time, second column E(t), then perturbation theory results for 3 states
